Basic example of word classification

The transformers package that is required can be installed using pip

I am not quite sure what the end application of this will be, but this is a basic proof of concept of text classification. 
Running the wordClassifier.py script will prompt you to enter a word or phrase and then return the top 5 clasifications the word or phrase falls under. These top 5 are out of a list of ~20 catagories I chose and can be easily changed. The time to run noted can change signifigantly depending on what machine they are run on.
I used the Hugging Face library and their pretrained NLP models to do these classifications.
