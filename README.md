Basic example of word classification

I am not quite sure what the end application of this will be, but this is a basic proof of concept of text classification. 
Running the wordClassification.py script will prompt you to enter a word or phrase and then return the top 10 clasifications the word or phrase falls under. The top 10 are out of a list of 100 paramaters I made and can be easily changed. 
I used the Hugging Face library and their pretrained NLP models to do these classifications.
